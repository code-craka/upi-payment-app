## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: 18+ (LTS recommended)
- **pnpm**: Package manager (recommended over npm/yarn)
- **MongoDB**: 5.0+ with replica set support
- **Redis**: 6.2+ for session management (required)
- **Git**: For version control

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/code-craka/upi-payment-app.git
   cd upi-payment-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env.local` file with the following:
   ```env
   # Database
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/upi-admin-dashboard-dev
   
   # Redis (Required)
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your-dev-password
   
   # Authentication (Clerk)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
   
   # Security
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-development-secret-key
   CSRF_SECRET=your-csrf-secret-key
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**
   - Visit <http://localhost:3000>
   - Check API health: <http://localhost:3000/api/test-db>
   - Verify Redis connection: <http://localhost:3000/api/debug/session>
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows

### Running Tests

\`\`\`bash

# Run all tests

pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode

pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage report

pnpm test:coverage
\`\`\`

### Writing Tests

- Use Jest for unit and integration tests
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Playwright for E2E tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security Requirements

- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Authentication & Authorization

- All protected routes must verify user authentication
- Implement role-based access control
- Use secure session management
- Audit all sensitive operations
